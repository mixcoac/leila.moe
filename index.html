		<h2>about me</h2>
		<p>I'm a <abbr title="For personal reasons, I prefer to celebrate/count my birthdate starting in January 6th.">17-year-old</abbr> hardware engineer from Mexico City.</p>
		<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXDC4dhxvcg">I was born at the age of 0 in a hospital that still exists, I enjoy writing essays and listening to avant-garde music, I love Italian food; specially when I cook it, and my right inner ear is partially deaf as a result of an accident with a bank alarm.</a></p>
		<p>Aside from being an engineer or something, I'm also a writer, developer, archivist, and economist of sorts.</p>
		<p>I don't have many hobbies as I spend most of my time at work, but when I find some free time to spare I do creative writing, listen to music, make music, or do planespotting at the Mexico City Airport.</p>
		<p>I'm a native Spanish and English speaker, and I'm currently learning Russian.</p>
		<h2>work</h2>
		<p>I'm currently working as the Lead of <a href="https://r23.xyz">Runway23</a>, a limited-profit cooperative focused on creating and developing free and open software by acting as a project incubator. For the most part, I spend my time managing Runway23 itself, but I also develop projects alongside the team and offer IT services for small companies within the Valley of Mexico area.</p>
		<p>At Runway23, I'm the codeower of the following projects, <i><a href="https://insurgent.es">Insurgent</a></i> -- a privacy-oriented worksuite (mail, calendar and contacts) inspired by services like SDF and Riseup, and <i>Prisu</i> -- an open source reimplementation of Discord's Rich Presence as a Service for any platform to make use of.</p>
		<p>In the past I've been involved in many projects and teams. To name a few, I've been involved with <a href="https://ameliorated.io">Ameliorated</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gNK9QhWQ9Q">The Hitogata Search Team</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211007193427/https://github.com/ManchildProductions/Male-Poon/">Male Poon</a> and <i>Estrelar</i>.</p>
		<p>I also write professionally, typically on projects related to public transport; one of my most notable projects is (and was) Projecto Garibaldi, a collaborative-writing project consisting in a series of "booklets" surrounding Mexico City and it's various public transport systems, trying to highlight key issues with them and offering open solutions to them.</p>
		<p>Aside from public transport, I also write articles about personal finances, engineering, and civil aviation in/for multiple platforms and outlets.</p>
		<p>I also have experience in professional video editing, working as a freelance video editor from 2020 to 2021, in which I worked with clients of many ranges, from small local coffee shops to the biggest telecommunications provider in Sweden.</p>
		<h2 id="contact">contact</h2>
		<p>I prefer to be contacted through Telegram or Email, however I also have a Discord -- but I prefer for only set acquaintances to contact me through it. Cheers.</p>
    	<ul>
        	<li>email: <a href="mailto:leila@insurgent.es">leila@insurgent.es</a></li>
        	<li>telegram: <a href="https://t.me/lulico">@lulico</a></li>
        	<li>discord: <a href="https://discord.com/users/452283991006117908">@lulico</a> -- only if close</li>
	    </ul>
	    <h3>keys and signatures</h3>
	    <p>As per common opsec practices, I typically sign my emails, commits or any other relevant message when possible. I do this with the following GPG key:</p>
	    <ul><li>Leila Sother (leila@insurgent.es) - (<a href="https://keys.openpgp.org/vks/v1/by-fingerprint/19386A70428AEAE1BE73E9CAFD2448EA6A5A1D47">FD24 48EA 6A5A 1D47</a>) - <a href="leila.gpg">download</a></li></ul>
	    <p>And if you'd like me to get into your machine for whatever reason, this is my SSH key:</p>
	    <ul><li>Palemachine - <a href="palemachine.pub">download</a></li></ul>
	    <p>Alongside these keys, I also provide the a file called "id.txt". This file is used as a mean to publicly state and verify my identity for verification purposes, a copy of it can be found <a href="id.txt">here</a>.</p>
	    <h2>socials & profiles</h2>
	    <p>I'm pretty much all over the place, although I spend most of my time in Akkoma and Cohost -- writing quick microblogs in the former and long posts and blogs on the latter.</p>
	    <p>There are some others where I sometimes do things in, but I'm pretty much out of the public eye yknow. I list some of them in case you're interested on following me or blocking me.</p>
	    <ul>
	    	<li><a href="https://last.fm/user/kamikodev">last.fm</a></li>
	    	<li><a href="https://old.reddit.com/u/kritterhouse">reddit</a></li>
	    	<li><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/lulico">steam</a></li>

	    	<li><a href="https://codeberg.org/kitsune">codeberg</li>
	    	<li><a href="https://twitter.com/caiflanes">twitter</a></li>
	    	<li><a href="https://bitcafe.me/leila">bitcafe</a></li>
	    </ul>
	    <h2>writings</h2>
	    <p>There are two kinds of writings (or as i call them, "writeups") that I write, informal (posts) and formal (articles).</p>
	    <p>As far as informal writeups go, I've started to move to <a href="https://cohost.org/leila">Cohost</a> to publish many of my longer posts, typically about my personal life or topics that interest me.</p>
	    <p>As far as formal writeups go, I still write full-blown articles and papers from time to time, most of them are under wraps due to them being mostly incomplete (typically making me work on many at once, or abandoning some). I plan to release them in the future in journals.</p>
	    <h2>F.A.Q</h2>
	    <p>Here's some questions that I get asked every now and then or that I just ask myself and project in here so others know the answers and I don't have to answer them or something.</p>
	    <h3>identity</h3>
	    <q>are you gay or trans?</q>
	    <p>Yes. I identify as a trans woman and I'm a sapphic demisexual.</p>
	    <q>are you therian?</q>
	    <p>Yes. My otherkin is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_raccoon_dog">Tanuki</a>. I use the üçÉ emoji to represent it too.</p>
	    <q>are you autistic?</q>
	    <p>Yes. I'm diagnosed with Aspergers and ADHD.</p>
	    <q>are you related to (insert name here) Sother?</q>
	    <p>Probably not. I started to use the last name Sother while I was in an <a href="https://cohost.org/leila/post/3682412-an-ode-to-a-blue-hai">(abusive, click here)</a> relationship with Alyxia Sother. During our relationship, I adopted it, and kept it due to personal issues regarding my identity. Somethings just stick around I guess.</p>
	    <h3>work</h3>
	    <q>are you part of Ameliorated?</q>
	    <p>Not anymore. I was unofficially a volunteer for the project from 2021 to 2023, and I left the project in September 2023 due to conflicts with the team.</p>
	    <q>can i contact you about Insurgent?</q>
	    <p>Depends. If your inquiry is about support, please refer to <a>Insurgent's support page</a>; if it's about the service from a corporate standpoint (ie, vulnerability reports, public comments, etc), email me at leila@r23.xyz.</p>
	    <h3>other stuff</h3>
	    <q>what music do you like?</q>
	    <p>I'm into indie stuff, mainly in the alternative and rock side of things. My favourite artists are Enter Shikari, Twenty One Pilots, Porter, Tom Vek, and Zo√©. I also have a <a href="https://www.last.fm/user/kamikodev">Last.fm</a> if you're interested.</p>
	    <q>are you on HRT?</q>
	    <p>Depending on when you read this, yes. I started HRT through DIY means on 6th of April 2023, and remained on it until December 2023. I am currently waiting for my follow-up appointment to have my first prescription filled out with an endocrinologist.</p>
	    <q>why did you block me?</q>
	    <p>I didn't block you. I never block anyone, ever.</p>
	    <q>can we be moots?</q>
	    <p>yes bestie uwu :></p>
