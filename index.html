		<h2>about me</h2>
		<p>I'm a 16-year-old trans <a href="ast/contentcreator.jpg">content creator</a> from Mexico City.</p>
		<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXDC4dhxvcg">I was born at the age of 0 in a hospital that still exists, I enjoy listening to avant-garde music and reheating Little Caesars Pizza.</a></p>
		<p>I'm a writer, developer, engineer, archivist, and economist of sorts; hence why I prefer to address myself as a "content creator". I'm also not the best at describing who I am, however I am working on an <a href="faq/index.html">FAQ page</a> to try and describe myself a little bit more.</p>
		<p>Nowadays I don't have many hobbies, specially since <b><a href="https://cohost.org/leila/post/3494952-i-need-a-moment">I've taken to take a break from everything I'm doing to work on myself</a></b>. Although I typically do creative writing, listen to music, make music, or play videogames with my girlfriend during my free time.</p>
		<p>I'm a native Spanish and English speaker, and I also have fundamental awareness in Russian.</p>
		<h2>work</h2>
		<p>I'm currently working at <b>Northern</b>, a one-man consulting firm offering IT services for small companies in the Valley of Mexico area.</p>
		<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lulico/">I am available for hire, both independently and as part of Northern.</a></p>
		<p>I also write professionally. I work in multiple projects related to public transport; one of my most notable projects was Project Garibaldi, a collaborative-writing project consisting in a series of "booklets" surrounding Mexico City and it's various public transport systems, trying to highlight key issues with them and offering open solutions to them.</p>
		<p>Aside from public transport, I also write articles about personal finances, engineering, and civil aviation in/for multiple platforms and outlets.</p>
		<p>In the past I've been involved in many projects and teams, some like <a href="https://ameliorated.io">Ameliorated</a>, a project aiming to offer a more privacy-oriented Windows 10/11 installation. Others <i>The Hitogata Search Team</i>, a community-effort trying to find a lost Japanese PSA from the 80s. And some like <i>Estrelar</i>, a startup/group working in the field of aerospace attempting to expand possible uses of weather balloons on emergency situations, and makeshift cubesats made for educational purposes.</p>
		<p>I also have experience in professional video editing, working as a freelance video editor from 2020 to 2021, in which I worked with clients of many ranges, from small local coffee shops to the biggest telecommunications provider in Sweden.</p>
		<h2 id="contact">contact</h2>
		<p>I mainly use Telegram and Email. I also have a Discord but only for people who I already know. Thanks.</p>

	    <h4>DO NOT CONTACT ME FOR RISEUP INVITES</h4>
	    <h3>keys and signatures</h3>
	    <p>As per common opsec practices, I typically sign my emails, commits or any other relevant message when possible. I do this with the following GPG key:</p>
	    <ul><li>Leila Pineda (lulico@riseup.net) - (FD24 48EA 6A5A 1D47) - <a href="leila.pub">download</a></li></ul>
	    <p>And if you'd like me to get into your machine for whatever reason, this is my SSH key:</p>
	    <ul><li>Palemachine - <a href="palemachine.pub">download</a></li></ul>
	    <h2>socials</h2>
	    <p>I've taken the personal decision to leave all social media after I've realised the immense pressure its putting on my health and well-being, with the only platform in which I'm now active being Cohost. There are some others where I sometimes do things in, but I'm pretty much out of the public eye yknow. I list some of them in case you're interested on following me or blocking me.</p>
	    <ul>
	    	<li><a href="https://last.fm/user/kamikodev">last.fm</a></li>
	    	<li><a href="https://old.reddit.com/u/kritterhouse">reddit</a></li>

	    	<li><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/leila.moe">bluesky</a></li>
	    </ul>
	    <h2>writeups</h2>
	    <p>There are two kinds of writeups that I write, informal (posts) and formal (articles).</p>
	    <p>As far as informal writeups go, I've started to move to <a href="https://cohost.org/leila">Cohost</a> to publish everything I write or do, from my day-to-day posts to very long posts; I do this as I feel Cohost is a better suited platform for this due to its in-site culture and how the entire place is laid out.</p>
	    <p>As far as formal writeups go, I still write full-blown articles and papers from time to time, most of them are under wraps due to them being mostly incomplete (typically making me work on many at once, or abandoning some), but soon I'll start publishing some of them as time passes on this very website.</p>
	    <h2>friends</h2>
	    <p>This part of my website is dedicated at showcasing the websites or profiles some of my friends and acquaintances, of whom I highly recommend you to check out their work, specially as this place's very... incomplete to say the least.</p>
