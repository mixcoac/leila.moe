		<p>I'm a <a href="ast/contentcreator.jpg">content creator</a> from Mexico City, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXDC4dhxvcg">I was born at the age of 0 in a hospital that still exists, I enjoy listening to avant-garde music and reheating Little Caesars Pizza.</a></p>
		<p>I'm currently working as director of <b><abbr title="formerly Kritterhouse Mexico">Northern</abbr></b>, a one-man startup offering IT services for small companies in the Mexico City Metropolitan area. I am available for hire (both independently and as part of Northern).</p>
		<p>On my free time, I also work on multiple projects, one of my most notable projects is Plan Estudiante (Project Garibaldi), a collaborative-writing editorial project containing a series of books and writeups surrounding Mexico City (and it's metropolitan area and the situation it has with it's various public transport systems.</p>
		<p>This project was created/branched from Project Chapultepec, a project who's aim was to make a total-overhaul of the ticketing system used in Mexico City's Movilidad Integrada transport system, focusing on mobile payments and extendible pricing plans, by making use of collaborative writing and development to write a series of books and <abbr title="proof of concepts">PoCs</abbr> to propose the project to the Mexico City Governement.</p>
		<p>Aside from that I write articles about personal finances, aeronautics, engineering, public transport, music, and personal life issues in multiple platforms and outlets.</p>
		<h2 id="contact">contacting me</h2>

	    <h4>DO NOT CONTACT ME TO ASK ME FOR RISEUP INVITES</h4>
	    <h3>keys and signatures</h3>
	    <p>As per common practice, I typically sign my emails, commits or any other relevant message when I can. I do this with the following GPG key:</p>
