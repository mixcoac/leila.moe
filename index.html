		<h2>about me</h2>
		<p>I'm a <abbr title="For personal reasons, I prefer to celebrate/count my birthdate starting in January 6th.">17-year-old</abbr> trans hardware engineer from Mexico City.</p>
		<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXDC4dhxvcg">I was born at the age of 0 in a hospital that still exists, I enjoy writing essays and listening to avant-garde music, I love Italian food; specially when I cook it, and my right inner ear is partially deaf as a result of an accident with a bank alarm.</a></p>
		<p>Aside from being an engineer or something, I'm also a writer, developer, archivist, and economist of sorts.</p>
		<p>I don't have many hobbies as I spend most of my time at work, but when I find some free time to spare I do creative writing, listen to music, make music, or do planespotting at the Mexico City Airport.</p>
		<p>I'm a native Spanish and English speaker, and I'm currently learning Russian.</p>
		<h2>work</h2>
		<p>I'm currently working as the Lead of <a href="https://r23.xyz">Runway23</a>, a limited-profit cooperative focused on creating and developing free and open software by acting as a project incubator. For the most part, I spend my time managing and developing projects inside Runway23, but I also focus on offering IT services for small companies within the Valley of Mexico area. At Runway23, I'm the manager and codeowner of two projects, <i>Prisu</i> -- an open source reimplementation of Discord's Rich Presence for any platform to make use of, and <i>Insurgent</i> -- a privacy-oriented worksuite (mail, calendar, contacts and notes) inspired by services like SDF and Riseup.</p>
		<p>In the past I've been involved in many projects and teams. To name a few, I've been involved with <a href="https://ameliorated.io">Ameliorated</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gNK9QhWQ9Q">The Hitogata Search Team</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211007193427/https://github.com/ManchildProductions/Male-Poon/">Male Poon</a> and <i>Estrelar</i>.</p>
		<p>I also write professionally, typically on projects related to public transport; one of my most notable projects is Projecto Garibaldi, a collaborative-writing project consisting in a series of "booklets" surrounding Mexico City and it's various public transport systems, trying to highlight key issues with them and offering open solutions to them.</p>
		<p>Aside from public transport, I also write articles about personal finances, engineering, and civil aviation in/for multiple platforms and outlets.</p>
		<p>I also have experience in professional video editing, working as a freelance video editor from 2020 to 2021, in which I worked with clients of many ranges, from small local coffee shops to the biggest telecommunications provider in Sweden.</p>
		<h2 id="contact">contact</h2>
		<p>I prefer to be contacted through Telegram or Email, however I also have a Discord -- but I prefer for only set acquaintances to contact me through it. Cheers.</p>
    	<ul>
        	<li>email: <a href="mailto:lulico@riseup.net">lulico@riseup.net</a></li>
        	<li>telegram: <a href="https://t.me/lulico">@lulico</a></li>
        	<li>discord: <a href="https://discord.com/users/452283991006117908">@lulico</a></li>
	    </ul>
	    <h4>DO NOT CONTACT ME FOR RISEUP INVITES</h4>
	    <h3>keys and signatures</h3>
	    <p>As per common opsec practices, I typically sign my emails, commits or any other relevant message when possible. I do this with the following GPG key:</p>
	    <ul><li>Leila Pineda (lulico@riseup.net) - (FD24 48EA 6A5A 1D47) - <a href="leila.pub">download</a></li></ul>
	    <p>And if you'd like me to get into your machine for whatever reason, this is my SSH key:</p>
	    <ul><li>Palemachine - <a href="palemachine.pub">download</a></li></ul>
	    <h2>socials</h2>
	    <p>I'm pretty much all over the place, although I spend most of my time in Bluesky and Cohost -- writing quick microblogs in the former and long posts and blogs on the latter.</p>
	    <p>There are some others where I sometimes do things in, but I'm pretty much out of the public eye yknow. I list some of them in case you're interested on following me or blocking me.</p>
	    <ul>
	    	<li><a href="https://last.fm/user/kamikodev">last.fm</a></li>
	    	<li><a href="https://old.reddit.com/u/kritterhouse">reddit</a></li>
	    	<li><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/lulico">steam</a></li>
	    	<li><a href="https://namemc.com/profile/lulico.1">namemc</a></li>
	    	<li><a href="https://twitter.com/caiflanes">twitter</a></li>
	    	<li><a href="https://bitcafe.me/leila">bitcafe</a></li>
	    </ul>
	    <h2>writeups</h2>
	    <p>There are two kinds of writeups that I write, informal (posts) and formal (articles).</p>
	    <p>As far as informal writeups go, I've started to move to <a href="https://cohost.org/leila">Cohost</a> to publish everything I write or do, from my day-to-day posts to very long posts; I do this as I feel Cohost is a better suited platform for this due to its in-site culture and how the entire place is laid out.</p>
	    <p>As far as formal writeups go, I still write full-blown articles and papers from time to time, most of them are under wraps due to them being mostly incomplete (typically making me work on many at once, or abandoning some), but soon I'll start publishing some of them as time passes on this very website.</p>
	    <h2>F.A.Q</h2>
	    <p>Here's some questions that I get asked every now and then or that I just ask myself and project in here so others know the answers and I don't have to answer them or something.</p>
	    <h3>identity</h3>
	    <q>are you gay or trans?</q>
	    <p>Yes. I'm a trans woman and I'm a sapphic demisexual.</p>
	    <q>are you out of the closet?</q>
	    <p>Yes. I'm currently changing my name and gender marker legally.</p>
	    <q>are you single?</q>
	    <p>AND I'M READY TO MINGLE WOOOO</p>
	    <q>are you therian?</q>
	    <p>Yes. My otherkin is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_raccoon_dog">Tanuki</a>. I use the üçÉ emoji to represent it too.</p>
	    <q>are you autistic?</q>
	    <p>Yes. I am diagnosed with Aspergers and ADHD.</p>
	    <q>are you related to (insert name here) Sother?</q>
	    <p>Probably not. <a href="https://cohost.org/leila/post/3682412-an-ode-to-a-blue-hai">I was abused by Alyxia Sother</a>, during our relationship I adopted the last name Sother and kept it after breaking up with her due to personal issues with my identity where I simply could not adapt to another name. Somethings just stick around I guess.</p>
	    <h3>work</h3>
	    <q>are you part of Ameliorated?</q>
	    <p>Not anymore. I was unofficially a volunteer for the project during 2021 through 2023, but left the project due to internal conflicts with the team.</p>
	    <q>are you the Drakula dev?</q>
	    <p>Yes, please don't remind me of that.</p>
	    <h3>other stuff</h3>
	    <q>what music do you like?</q>
	    <p>I'm into indie rock for the most part, with my favourite artists being Enter Shikari, Twenty One Pilots, iDKHOW, and Tom Vek. I also have a <a href="https://www.last.fm/user/kamikodev">Last.fm</a> if you're interested.</p>
	    <q>are you on HRT?</q>
	    <p>Depending on when you read this, yes. I started HRT through DIY means on 6th of April 2023, and remained on it until December 2023. As of the time of writing this (24th of February 2024), I am currently counting down the hours for my appointment at the <a href="https://www.salud.cdmx.gob.mx/acciones/unidad-de-salud-integral-para-personas-trans-usipt">government-run trans clinic in Mexico City</a>.</p>
	    <q>what is your favourite food?</q>
	    <p>Arrabiata pasta and a medium-rare Ribeye steak accompanied with caramelised Cambray onions.</p>
	    <q>why did you block me?</q>
	    <p>I didn't block you. I never block anyone, ever. Stop whoring internet points.</p>
	    <q>can we be moots?</q>
	    <p>yes bestie uwu :></p>
