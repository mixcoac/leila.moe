		<h2>about me</h2>
		<p>I'm a <abbr title="For personal reasons, I prefer to celebrate/count my birthdate starting in January 6th.">17-year-old</abbr> trans <a href="ast/contentcreator.jpg">content creator</a> from Mexico City.</p>
		<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXDC4dhxvcg">I was born at the age of 0 in a hospital that still exists, I enjoy writing essays and listening to avant-garde music, I love Italian food; specially when I cook it, and my right inner ear is partially deaf as a result of an accident with a bank alarm.</a></p>
		<p>I'm a writer, developer, engineer, archivist, and economist of sorts; hence why I prefer to address myself as a "content creator". I'm also not the best at describing who I am, really.</p>
		<p>I don't have many hobbies as I spend most of my time at work, but when I find some free time to spare I do creative writing, listen to music, make music, do planespotting at the Mexico City Airport, or play videogames with my boyfriend.</p>
		<p>I'm a native Spanish and English speaker, and I'm currently learning Russian.</p>
		<h2>work</h2>
		<p>I'm currently working at <b>Runway23</b>, an independent consulting firm and project incubator. For the most part I focus on offering IT services for small companies within the Valley of Mexico area, but I also work as a software developer and hardware designer on some projects we have at hand; such as <i>Turut</i> -- an open source ticketing system focused on scalability and compatibility with other systems, or <i>Prisu</i> -- an open source reimplementation of Discord's Rich Presence for any platform to make use of.</p>
		<p>In the past I've been involved in many projects and teams. To name a few, I've been involved with <a href="https://ameliorated.io">Ameliorated</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gNK9QhWQ9Q">The Hitogata Search Team</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211007193427/https://github.com/ManchildProductions/Male-Poon/">Male Poon</a> and <i>Estrelar</i>.</p>
		<p>I also write professionally, typically on projects related to public transport; one of my most notable projects is Projecto Garibaldi, a collaborative-writing project consisting in a series of "booklets" surrounding Mexico City and it's various public transport systems, trying to highlight key issues with them and offering open solutions to them.</p>
		<p>Aside from public transport, I also write articles about personal finances, engineering, and civil aviation in/for multiple platforms and outlets.</p>
		<p>I also have experience in professional video editing, working as a freelance video editor from 2020 to 2021, in which I worked with clients of many ranges, from small local coffee shops to the biggest telecommunications provider in Sweden.</p>
		<p>I am available for hire, both <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lulico/">independently</a> and as part of Runway23.</p>
		<h2 id="contact">contact</h2>
		<p>I prefer to be contacted through Telegram or Email, however I also have a Discord -- but I prefer for only set acquaintances to contact me through it. Cheers.</p>

	    <h4>DO NOT CONTACT ME FOR RISEUP INVITES</h4>
	    <h3>keys and signatures</h3>
	    <p>As per common opsec practices, I typically sign my emails, commits or any other relevant message when possible. I do this with the following GPG key:</p>
	    <ul><li>Leila Pineda (lulico@riseup.net) - (FD24 48EA 6A5A 1D47) - <a href="leila.pub">download</a></li></ul>
	    <p>And if you'd like me to get into your machine for whatever reason, this is my SSH key:</p>
	    <ul><li>Palemachine - <a href="palemachine.pub">download</a></li></ul>
	    <h2>socials</h2>
	    <p>I've taken the personal decision to leave all social media after I've realised the immense pressure its putting on my health and well-being, with the only platform in which I'm now active being Cohost. There are some others where I sometimes do things in, but I'm pretty much out of the public eye yknow. I list some of them in case you're interested on following me or blocking me.</p>

	    </ul>
	    <h2>writeups</h2>
	    <p>There are two kinds of writeups that I write, informal (posts) and formal (articles).</p>
	    <p>As far as informal writeups go, I've started to move to <a href="https://cohost.org/leila">Cohost</a> to publish everything I write or do, from my day-to-day posts to very long posts; I do this as I feel Cohost is a better suited platform for this due to its in-site culture and how the entire place is laid out.</p>
	    <p>As far as formal writeups go, I still write full-blown articles and papers from time to time, most of them are under wraps due to them being mostly incomplete (typically making me work on many at once, or abandoning some), but soon I'll start publishing some of them as time passes on this very website.</p>
	    <h2>friends</h2>
	    <p>This part of my website is dedicated at showcasing the websites or profiles some of my friends and acquaintances, of whom I highly recommend you to check out their work, specially as this place's very... incomplete to say the least.</p>
