		<h2>about me</h2>
		<p>I'm a 16-year-old trans <a href="ast/contentcreator.jpg">content creator</a> from Mexico City.</p>
		<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXDC4dhxvcg">I was born at the age of 0 in a hospital that still exists, I enjoy listening to avant-garde music and reheating Little Caesars Pizza.</a></p>
		<p>I'm a writer, developer, engineer, archivist, and economist of sorts; hence why I prefer to address myself as a "content creator". I'm also not the best at describing who I am, specially because of my idea of selfishness, but I'm certain if you were to group up 20 acquaintances of mine in a room you'd get a pretty good view of who I am; although good luck trying to find that many people that know me.</p>
		<p>Nowadays I don't have many hobbies, I typically do creative writing, or listen to music during my free time, although I've recently taken an interest on modding the game Celeste. As of October 2023, I've been working on mod that pushes the boundaries of the game's core idea by implementing features like anti-gravity and skill-based puzzles to in order to offer the player more a more intricate gameplay using mechanics similar to games like VVVVVV and Portal.</p>
		<p>I'm a native Spanish and English speaker, and I also have fundamental awareness in Russian.</p>
		<h2>work</h2>
		<p>I'm currently working at <b>Northern</b>, a one-man company offering IT services for small companies in the Valley of Mexico area. I am available for hire (both independently and as part of Northern).</p>
		<p>I also write professionally. I've worked (and still do) in multiple projects related to public transport; one of my most notable projects is Plan Estudiante (Project Garibaldi), a collaborative-writing editorial project containing a series of "booklets" surrounding Mexico City and it's various public transport systems, trying to highlight key issues with them and offering solutions.</p>
		<p>Aside from public transport, I also write articles about personal finances, engineering, and civil aviation in/for multiple platforms and outlets.</p>
		<p>In the past I've been involved in many projects and teams, some like <a href="https://ameliorated.io">Ameliorated</a>, a project aiming to offer a more privacy-oriented Windows 10/11 installation. Others <i>The Hitogata Search Team</i>, a community-effort trying to find a lost Japanese PSA from the 80s. And some like <i>Estrelar</i>, a startup/group working on aerospace attempting to expand possible uses of weather balloons on emergency situations, and also trying to make Laika 2.0 by sending a rat to space.</p>
		<p>I also have experience in professional video editing, working as a freelance video editor from 2020 to 2021, in which I worked with clients of many ranges, from small local coffee shops to the biggest telecommunications provider in Sweden.</p>
		<h2 id="contact">contact</h2>
		<p>There are multiple methods to contact me, however I'm the most comfortable talking via email or Telegram, if both options are not available (ie, I take too long to reply or you are not comfortable with either platform) I am also available for contact through Discord.</p>
    	<ul>
        	<li>email: <a href="mailto:lulico@riseup.net">lulico@riseup.net</a></li>
        	<li>telegram: <a href="https://t.me/lulico">@lulico</a></li>
       		<li>discord: @lulico</li>
	    </ul>
	    <h5>DO NOT CONTACT ME FOR RISEUP INVITES</h5>
	    <h3>keys and signatures</h3>
	    <p>As per common practice, I typically sign my emails, commits or any other relevant message when possible. I do this with the following GPG key:</p>
	    <ul><li>Leila Pineda (lulico@riseup.net) - (FD24 48EA 6A5A 1D47) - <a href="leila.pub">download</a></li></ul>
	    <p>And if you'd like me to get into your machine for whatever reason, this is my SSH key:</p>
	    <ul><li>Palemachine - <a href="palemachine.pub">download</a></li></ul>
	    <h2>socials</h2>
	    <p>I don't use any social media aside from Twitter nowadays, however I'm still active and present in some other platforms, I list some of them not listed yet in case you're interested on following me.</p>
	    <ul>
	    	<li><a href="https://last.fm/user/kamikodev">last.fm</a></li>
	    	<li><a href="https://old.reddit.com/u/kritterhouse">reddit</a></li>
	    	<li><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/lulico">steam</a></li>
	    	<li><a href="https://namemc.com/profile/lulico.1">namemc</a></li>
	    </ul>
	    <h2>articles</h2>
	    <p>I've started to move to <a href="https://cohost.com/leila">Cohost</a> to publish most of my writings, as I feel Cohost is a better suited platform to most of my work due to it's rich formatting tools and it's overall "lack of formality" due to being a blogging site. However, I still write full-blown articles and papers from time to time, most of them are under wraps due to them being mostly incomplete (typically making me work on many at once, or abandoning some), but soon I'll start publishing some of them as time passes on this very website.</p>
	    <p>But for now, you can see <a href="https://cohost.com/leila">my Cohost blog</a> and some of my tweets in <a href="https://twitter.com/caiflanes">Twitter</a>.</p>
	    <h2>friends</h2>
	    <p>This part of my website is dedicated at showcasing the websites or profiles some of my friends and acquaintances, of whom I highly recommend you to check out their work, specially as this place's very... incomplete to say the least.</p>
